## Short bio

I am an applied Bayesian statistician working on public health problems. I am currently based in London working as a research fellow at the LSHTM, UK, and I also hold permanent position at Fiocruz, Brazil.  My main research interests are on developing Bayesian statistical solutions/models to applied real problems, usually research question for infectious diseases. I am interested in problems in which the usual statistical model approaches (e.g. LM, GLMs) are not appropriate.
