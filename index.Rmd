I am an applied Bayesian statistician. 

  - Public health researcher in the [PROCC](http://www.procc.fiocruz.br) at the [Fiocruz](http://www.fiocruz.br) 
  - Research Fellow at the [CMMID](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/centres/centre-mathematical-modelling-infectious-diseases) at the [LSHTM](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/)

My main interest is on _developing_ Bayesian statistical solutions/models to applied problems, usually public health problems. I am interested in problems where the usual statistical model assumptions (e.g. independence, normality) are not valid.
