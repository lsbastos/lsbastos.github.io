I am an applied Bayesian statistician working at the [Scientific Computing Program (PROCC)](http://www.procc.fiocruz.br) in the [Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz)](http://www.fiocruz.br). 

My main interest is on _developing_ Bayesian statistical models to applied problems, usually public health problems. I am interested in problems where the usual statistical model assumptions (e.g. independence, normality) are not valid, this may explain the big variability among areas of application in my CV, varying from micro (analysis of mosquito data) to macro (National epidemics).
